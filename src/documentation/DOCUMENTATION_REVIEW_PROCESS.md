# Documentation Review Process

## Overview

This document outlines the procedure for reviewing and updating documentation before implementing code changes. Our approach ensures that documentation remains accurate, up-to-date, and serves as a reliable reference for developers.

## Pre-Implementation Review

Before implementing any code changes, especially fixes for bugs or errors, the following documentation should be reviewed:

1. **ERROR_LOG.md**: Review current and past errors to understand patterns and avoid regression
2. **TYPE_INCONSISTENCIES.md**: Check for related type issues that might affect your changes
3. **BUILD_ERROR_RESOLUTION.md**: Review standard approaches for the type of issue being fixed
4. **SCHEMA_CHANGELOG.md**: Understand recent schema changes that might impact your work

## Documentation Update Workflow

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - Document the issue in ERROR_LOG.md
   - Add error messages, affected files, and initial analysis

2. **Pre-Implementation Updates**:
   - Update relevant documentation with planned approach
   - Document potential side effects or impacts on other components
   - Note any architecture decisions or trade-offs

3. **Post-Implementation Updates**:
   - Mark completed steps in ERROR_LOG.md
   - Update status of the issue
   - Document the solution implemented
   - Add any new learnings or patterns discovered

4. **Final Review**:
   - Ensure documentation accurately reflects the implemented solution
   - Add prevention strategies for similar issues
   - Cross-reference related documentation

## Types of Documentation

### Technical Documentation

- **Type System**: Keep interfaces, types, and schemas documented
- **API Contracts**: Document expected inputs/outputs and error cases
- **Database Schema**: Maintain current schema documentation with relationships

### Process Documentation

- **Error Resolution**: Document common errors and their solutions
- **Debugging Process**: Maintain guides for troubleshooting specific areas
- **Development Workflows**: Document standard procedures for common tasks

## Automation Goals

To improve our documentation process, we aim to:

1. Automatically update ERROR_LOG.md when build errors occur
2. Generate type relationship diagrams for complex interfaces
3. Maintain a living history of fixed issues with their solutions
4. Track documentation coverage of the codebase

## Review Checklist

Before implementing changes, confirm:

- [ ] All relevant documentation has been reviewed
- [ ] The error is documented in ERROR_LOG.md
- [ ] Similar past issues have been checked for solutions
- [ ] The planned approach is documented
- [ ] Potential impacts on other components are considered

After implementing changes:

- [ ] Solution is documented
- [ ] Error log is updated with resolution
- [ ] Any new patterns or learnings are documented
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects the current state

This process helps maintain a self-healing codebase where issues are systematically addressed and knowledge is preserved for future development.
