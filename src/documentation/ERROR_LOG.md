## Active Issues

### TypeScript Errors in Form Schema Validator

**Status:** In Progress  
**First Identified:** 2024-06-19  
**Last Updated:** 2024-06-19  
**Severity:** High  

**Description:**
Type errors in formSchemaValidator.ts preventing successful build.

**Error Messages:**
- `Argument of type 'unknown' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ZodTypeAny'`
- `Type '{}' is missing the following properties from type 'ZodType<any, any, any>': _type, _output, _input, _def, and 32 more.`

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The formSchemaValidator.ts utility is not properly type-casting variables to ZodTypeAny before using them with Zod-specific functions.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. ✅ Add proper type assertions for Zod types
2. ⬜ Review other Zod utilities for similar issues
3. ⬜ Consider refactoring formSchemaValidator.ts into smaller functions

## Resolved Issues

### Work Order Form Type Inconsistencies

**Status:** Resolved  
**First Identified:** 2024-06-14  
**Last Updated:** 2024-06-19  
**Resolved On:** 2024-06-19  
**Severity:** High  

**Description:**
Type errors in WorkOrderForm and workOrderService preventing successful build.

**Error Messages:**
- `Property 'isSubmitting' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & FormActionsProps'`
- `Property 'description' is optional in type but required in Supabase insert call`
- `Property 'site_id' is optional in type but required in type...`

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The FormActions component didn't include isSubmitting in its props interface
- The workOrderService.ts insert function requires description and site_id fields but they were being treated as optional in the form schema
- Inconsistency between form schema (optional fields) and database requirements (required fields)

**Resolution Steps:**
1. ✅ Update FormActions component to include isSubmitting prop
2. ✅ Ensure description is properly handled as required in workOrderService.ts
3. ✅ Add validation for site_id before database operation
4. ✅ Explicitly include required fields in prepared data
5. ✅ Add error logging and documentation

**Related Files:**
- src/components/operations/workOrder/form-sections/FormActions.tsx
- src/services/workOrders/workOrderService.ts

**Prevention Measures:**
- Added runtime validation for required fields before database submission
- Enhanced error capture to document similar issues automatically
- Updated Build Error Resolution guide with specific fixes for this pattern

6. Create initial resolution steps if known

### Updating Issues

When working on an issue:

1. Update the "Last Updated" date
2. Mark completed steps with ✅
3. Add new information discovered during investigation
4. Refine the root cause analysis as more is learned
