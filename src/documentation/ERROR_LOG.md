## Active Issues

### Work Order Type Inconsistencies

**Status:** In Progress  
**First Identified:** 2025-03-30  
**Last Updated:** 2025-03-30  
**Severity:** High  

**Description:**
Multiple TypeScript errors related to WorkOrder types, particularly with date handling between string and Date object types, and inconsistencies between WorkOrder and WorkOrderFormValues interfaces.

**Error Messages:**
- `Type 'Partial<WorkOrder>' is not assignable to type 'Partial<WorkOrderFormValues>'`
- `Type 'string | Date' is not assignable to type 'Date'`
- `Property 'id' does not exist on type 'Partial<WorkOrderFormValues>'`
- Type error in `insert` call in workOrderService.ts

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The WorkOrder interface has date fields (scheduled_start, due_date) that can be either string or Date
- The WorkOrderFormValues expects only Date objects
- The WorkOrderFormValues interface doesn't include an 'id' field but it's being referenced
- The insert function in createWorkOrder expects different format than provided

**Resolution Steps:**
1. ✅ Review the interfaces in workOrder.schema.ts
2. ✅ Examine date handling in formatDateForDb utility
3. ⬜ Update WorkOrderForm component to properly convert between types
4. ⬜ Fix type inconsistencies in useWorkOrderForm hook
5. ⬜ Fix the insert function call in workOrderService.ts

5. List files likely to be involved
6. Create initial resolution steps if known

### Updating Issues

When working on an issue:

1. Update the "Last Updated" date
2. Mark completed steps with ✅
3. Add new information discovered during investigation
4. Refine the root cause analysis as more is learned
5. Add new resolution steps as needed

### Resolving Issues

When an issue is resolved:

1. Change status to "Resolved"
2. Add the resolution date
3. Document the final root cause
4. Document the complete resolution
5. List all affected files
6. Move the issue to the "Resolved Issues" section
7. Add any prevention measures implemented

This log should be updated regularly as part of the development process to maintain an accurate record of issues and their resolutions.
